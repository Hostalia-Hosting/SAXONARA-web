                    <blockquote>For these recordings, I use a selection of <strong>professional saxophones</strong> adapted to each moment of the event. The tenor saxophone and alto saxophone are perfect for cocktail hours, <strong>pool parties</strong> and vibrant celebrations, blending seamlessly with <strong>House, Lounge, Jazz, Pop and DJ sets</strong>. For more emotional and intimate moments — such as a <strong>wedding ceremony</strong> or special entrance — I often choose the soprano saxophone, whose warm and delicate sound enhances the emotion of the moment.</blockquote>
