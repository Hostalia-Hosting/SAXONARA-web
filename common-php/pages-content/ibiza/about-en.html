                    <p><b>Looking for a unique, stylish and energetic live <strong>saxophone performance</strong> for your wedding or event in Ibiza?</b></p>
                    <p>I've <b>collaborated with countless DJs</b> and performed at a wide variety of <strong>events across Ibiza</strong> — from intimate villa gatherings to vibrant beach club parties. I also offer a unique <strong>solo sax live set</strong>, where I seamlessly blend jazzy melodies with deep house and iconic <b>Ibiza-style beats</b>, creating a truly immersive musical journey.</p>
                    <p>My training includes prestigious music schools in <b>Spain</b>, the <b>USA</b>, and <b>Puerto Rico</b>, which allows me to fuse <strong>Latin rhythms</strong> with modern electronic sounds, adding richness and versatility to every performance.</p>
                    <p>Ibiza is more than a destination — it's a lifestyle. With its breathtaking beaches, lively culture and legendary party scene, it's the perfect stage for unforgettable events. You'll often find me <strong>performing live</strong> at top hotels, exclusive clubs and <strong>luxury weddings</strong> all around the island.</p>
